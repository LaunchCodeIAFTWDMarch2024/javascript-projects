const input = require('readline-sync');

//1) Use string methods to remove the first three characters from the string and add them to the end.
//Hint - define another variable to hold the new string or reassign the new string to str.
let newStr = str.slice(3,10) + str.slice(0,3)

//Use a template literal to print the original and modified string in a descriptive phrase.
console.log(`Original word ${str} was modified to say ${newStr}`)

//2) Modify your code to accept user input. Query the user to enter the number of letters that will be relocated.
let userInput = input.question("How many letters would you like to move? ")
let userStr = ''
if (userInput < 10 && userInput > 0) {
    userStr = str.slice(userInput,10) + str.slice(0, userInput);
    console.log(`Original word ${str} was modified to say ${userStr}`)
} else console.log(`User input outside the range of accepted indices.`)

//3) Add validation to your code to deal with user inputs that are longer than the word. In such cases, default to moving 3 characters. Also, the template literal should note the error.
